 * Comments: This is and the accompanying source file are for interfacing with
 *           the MCP2515 CAN Controller IC. This is where part of the magic
 *           happens and is a central part of the project!
 * Revision history: Ver. 0.1
 * 
 * NOTE! References I used for the development of this header and the source
 * file was the following git repos:
 *      - https://github.com/spirilis/mcp2515.git
 *      - https://github.com/autowp/arduino-mcp2515.git
 * I have my own take on the driver files for this IC but these were very
 * helpful. I should also add that my intent went beyond just making a CAN
 * node; I want to also send specific J1939 messages.
